Holder for two sets of code that I use a fair bit in my own Godot programming, so I thought I'd make them addons in case anyone else wants to make use of them.

  MinMaxCalculator - an implementation of an generic alpha-beta pruning tree for use in simple strategic games for making the best tactical decision in a deterministic game.
  StateMachine - a simple control node state machine for determining which parts of a game should be up and running at any time. There are other state machine implementations, but I find this one useful for transtioning between game stages.
